# Basic Discord Bot for Checking Crypto Prices

This code tells Discord the current price of the cryptocurrency (such as BTC) entered with the **_!control_** command.

**However, it has significantly improved how to interact with binance-api-node and the Discord API before using this bot. Also this bot only shows prices, additional functionality can be implemented for real trading.**
